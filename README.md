# Team-Project-for-Progamming-Fundamentals-1
First, thanks for Dave's ShopV2.2!
The project is a very easy restaurant management game. 
As the owner of the restaurant, what you need to do is to choose suitable dishes for the customers.
For example, providing a customer who wants a drink with a serving of pasta is invalid.
And the goal of this game is to get as many points as you can.
That's all for our team project.
